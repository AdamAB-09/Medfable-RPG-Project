Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The NavMesh isn't properly responding whenever the player walks onto the bridge
2. Whenever the player attacks an enemy and moves away then attacks again, they will not peform their attacking animation correctly
3. The melee attack has a certain range it will be executed at however, the player or enemy will go right up to one another at close range attacking
4. The entity will face the direction they walked in when attacking the other entity and perform their animation in that direction
5. When assigning an enemy with a certain patrol path they will remain still rather than following it
6. The fading system works by fading out and back in when passing through an entry point however, this isn't happening
7. Player isn't frozen in place when passing through the cutscene object that triggers the cinematic scene
8. The GUIDs for savable entites are duplicates thus data isn't being saved propery
9. Whenever the player saves in scene x then reloads the game from scene y, they will be placed outside the map
10. Weapons have their own corresponding animation however, the melee animation is being shown 


Steps to reproduce
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Player or enemies attempts to walk onto the bridge
2. Attack the enemy, move away, attack again
3. Attack an enemy or allow enemy to attack player
4. Attack an enemy or allow enemy to attack player in a direction not facing the other target
5. In the Unity Editor, assign the enemy with a patrol path
6. Pass through an entry point
7. Pass through the cinematic gameobject box collider
8. Drag a prefab into the scene and then save and load
9. Save the game in scene x, reload game from scene y
10. Pick up a weapon and attack an enemy


Expected result
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. They should be able to walk across succesfully with no jittering or stopping
2. The player should attack as they were normally
3. The melee attack animation should be performed a small distance away from the other combat entity 
4. Both entities should be facing one another when attacking each other
5. They should follow the patrol path as intended 
6. Passing through an entry point should fade out briefly and then fade back in after the new scene loaded
7. User shouldn't have control of their player when cutscene is triggered
8. The entities should have their data saved and loaded correctly such as their position, health etc 
9. The player should have their last saved position when reloading the game no matter the scene they do it from
10. Player should be utilising the correct animation attached to the weapon they pick up


Actual result
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. They sometimes don't move across or their animations are jittering
2. They would perform half their animation for the first attack and not hit, they will only hit after
3. The entity will be up close to the other entity thus making the melee attack animation go through their body which is unapealling
4. The entities will be facing away from each other depending on where they move to when attacking
5. They remain still in their spawning point and don't follow the patrol path
6. Even when the new scene is loaded in, the screen remains black due to the fade out effect and not fading back in
7. User still has control of player when cinematic scene occurs
8. Two seperate entites with the same GUID will share the same save data
9. It places the player outside the map or in an area they're not supposed to be in
10. Melee animation is being performed when attacking with the weapon pick up
